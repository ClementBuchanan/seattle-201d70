# The DOM, Domain Modeling, and Introduction to Objects

<a id="top"></a>

### Week One Feedback Review
#### Pros and Truths
- This is Hard!
- safe environment!
- pair programming for the win / collaboration in general / bouncing ideas around
- Code review very helpful
- Canvas submissions - due at 8:59am or 11:59pm - working late.  
- stacked learning for the win
#### Cons and Improvables
- Hard time staying engaged 
  - Latent knowledge? NOT a bad thing!  Perfecting what you've got and talking with others is a great way to manage this for now.  Week 2, Newer more challenging material is coming.
- Long Lectures 
  - hasn't been received harshly -good, but TRUTH the lectures have been long.  Week 2, you'll notice more foucs
- Canvas is a bit clunky
  - yes, and it hits different folks in different ways.... it's FREE and a best option considering what's out there

#### In a nut shell:  
> This week has been challenging, exhausting, and frustrating, but also encouraging, and fulfilling

> So far Code Fellows has exceeded my expectations. The course content is well structured and thought out. There is an ample amount of engagement and support. It is top-notch.

> The overall combination of elements -- all these elements are nested together and gradually build upon themselves.

> I love the pace and the help that is available. I love the priority on it being OK for everyone to do things their own way and take care of themselves when necessary.

> I feel a sense of community here and that means a lot.

#### Instructor Reflection
> Lectures have been very long.  We've struck a balance based on what question folks have had about all of the things and the entire group's understanding. Take aways:  People know they are safe.  We have "buy in" and the group can navigate this system.  BIG WIN.  The other side of this is that we've held some to longer lectures than they needed in this effort reinforce the group.  In week one this very much helps our community, I appreciate the entire group's patience and I am not sad by those net results.  In week 2 however, I will be more concise; our topics are more specific this week.  Bottom line:  we need to consume some difficult concepts and stil have time to do all the stuff and things!  All of the things we talked about in week one will help us on this journey.  Quite literally, the hard work done in week 1, makes week two a bit easier!

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing Lecture 6 of Code 201, students will:

- Be able to translate a real-world problem domain into a code model by using provided user stories and technical requirements, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate an understanding of how the browser represents an HTML document as an object that can be manipulated with JavaScript, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Use JavaScript to dynamically render array data as an unordered list in the DOM, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment
- Demonstrate an understanding of how object literals are structured in JavaScript, as well as how to access and reassign values/functionality to their properties and methods, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.
- Demonstrate an understanding of how dot notation and bracket notation are used to access/reassign properties and methods in JavaScript objects, as measured by successful completion of the daily code assignment and a quiz administered in Canvas.

### One-on-One Meetings

The instructor will have a 15-minute one-on-one meeting with each student during the coming week: this will be an opportunity to review your progress, answer any questions you have, and discuss any topics the instructor sees appropriate, such as your future plans in the program. We will start the process of scheduling those meetings very soon.
